                    <h1>Looping and Waiting</h1>
                    <p>Learn how to repeat commands instantly, or with a period. Also learn about waiting before executing another command.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Waiting</h2>
                    <p>Waiting can become very useful when you want to wait for a bit before continuing down the command line. The command to wait is just the word <span class="high">wait</span>. The second argument would be the number of seconds to wait, and it can be a <span class="high">decimal</span>.</p>
                    <p>The third argument would just be the command line to execute.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <code>wait 0.5 ...</code>
                    <p>The <span class="high">...</span> can be replaced with any command line.</p>
                    <code>wait 1.0 send Hello world</code>
                    <p>Recall from our previous lesson that send would privately dm the client, and not say something in global chat.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>Another type of waiting is <span class="high">wait_random</span></p>
                    <p>This takes in 2 arguments: min, max</p>
                    <p>These arguments would be your wait time!</p>
                    <code>wait_random 0.0 0.5 input attack</code>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Looping</h2>
                    <p>Looping means to execute a command line <span class="high">N</span> times. The <span class="high">N</span> is specified during the first argument, whereas the command line the third.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <code>loop 5 say /give @s diamond</code>
                    <p>This would loop executing the give command 5 times, resulting in giving yourself 5 diamonds.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Periodical Looping</h2>
                    <p>This also means looping with a period. A period in physics normally means how long it takes to do one repitition of something, and that can be applied to this command as well.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>This command would have 3 arguments</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>how many times it'll loop</li>
                        <li>the period</li>
                        <li>the command line</li>
                    </ul>
                    <code>loop_period 5 1000 say /give @s diamond</code>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>This would essentially give the player a diamond every 1000 milliseconds, or one second, for 5 times.</p>
