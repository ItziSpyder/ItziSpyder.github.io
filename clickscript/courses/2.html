                    <h1>Basics</h1>
                    <p>Learn basic script syntax: printing in console, checking errors in logs, commenting, and more!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Printing in console</h2>
                    <p>Printing in console is fairly easy. The command name is <span class="high">print</span> followed by a message of your choice.</p>
                    <code>print Hello World!</code>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Checking errors</h2>
                    <p>The console has more to just printing stuff in it. First of all lets talk about navigating to it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>Minecraft has a folder under <span class="high">.minecraft</span> named <span class="high">logs</span>.</p>
                    <p>Inside the folder, there would be a file you have to open, named <span class="high">latest.log</span></p>

                    <p>This is where everything from the console is saved to. From there, you can check any script errors that may have been caught and printed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Commenting</h2>
                    <p>Comments are made just like in Java, however they require to be on their on line. Comments are prefixed with <span class="high">2 forward slashes</span>.</p>
                    <code>// this is a comment</code>
