This mod is very explicit in being advertised as providing CPvP assistance/advantages. While previous takedowns have been about specific features, the user report has brought to light some information about the mod's core features and how they work together to provide an explicit advantage over others who do not have this mod, thus being in violation of our Content Rules. Because of the popularity of this mod, it would be wrong of us to take down the mod entirely; however, because of how much of an advantage it can give, it is not eligible to be listed in search, and will only be available via direct link."}, {"title": "A parting to all", "desc": "The message from above has highlighted the main features of this mod working together to create something far more advanced: ClickCrystal + ObiSwitch + CrystSwitch. And because removing core modules from the mod is equivalent to deleting the mod entirely, we've finally lost the battle. As of 9/18/2023, ClickCrystals is officially discontinued from future development."}, {"title": "One last thanks", "desc": "It was really fun on the journey with you all while it lasted, and I really appreciate the support. However, this may seem to be the end of ClickCrystals. <n>Happy coding and cpvping!"}]}
