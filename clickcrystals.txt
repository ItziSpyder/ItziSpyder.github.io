            <p class="desc">ClickCrystals seeks to address a common concern: the complexity of hot-keying in Minecraft. This mod aims to enhance the user experience by streamlining hotkey actions, offering ease and convenience without introducing unfair advantages. We are constantly emphasizing that the mod does not include built-in macros, placing a spotlight on its purpose as a tool to simplify gameplay mechanics.</p>
            <p class="desc">The mod encourages users to explore its capabilities firsthand before making assumptions. It’s worth noting that several features initially accused of providing “unfair advantages” have been removed, demonstrating our commitment to refining the mod’s functionality and maintaining fair gameplay.</p>

All hotkey modules are set to remain, with any potential changes or removals subject to community voting. This approach ensures that the mod’s evolution remains aligned with the community’s needs and desires.</p>
